You can create a Ziggy cluster to address your scalability and redundancy needs.

## Before you create your cluster
You should be familiar with the performance tuning settings before you add instances. This will help you tune your instances which still applies when running multiple servers.

## Load Testing
Ziggy comes with its own [load testing](user-guide/Global-Settings.md#load-test) feature that lets you experiment with different load scenarios and system settings.

It is important to understand how to adjust the main settings that will influence performance on a single server. You can make these adjustments and immediately see the impact when running a load test.

## Scaling
A single Ziggy server can handle large numbers of simultaneously executing flows. However, if you are dealing with very high load, then creating a cluster is the answer.

## Redundancy
There are different ays to configure your cluster for high-availability scenarios.
