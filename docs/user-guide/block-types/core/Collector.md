# Collector

The Collector Block has one main purpose and one secondary purpose.

- It acts as a gathering point for the completion of prior Blocks. It won't pass data onwards until all incoming edge data is populated.
- You can set the **Sleep** value so it also waits the specified amount of time before passing execution to subsequent Blocks.
