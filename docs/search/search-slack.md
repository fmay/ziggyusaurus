Rather like [ChatterBox](search-chatterbox.md), you can perform natural language queries from Slack. This allows your teams to perform any query on any data without the hassle of leaving Slack and navigating through screens in the browser.

## Slack App
We, or you, can configure a custom, personal Slack App calls Ziggy Flows and returns Slack formatted data to a personal DM or channel.

The key features are

- Enter natural language queries
- Home screen with saved queries at the user level
- Unlimited / commands associated with Ziggy Flows
- Full control over how the response data is displayed in Slack.

## App configuration 
Configuring the Slack App just requires a free developer account. We can supply a **templated manifest file** that you can customize and paste into the Slack configuration UI.

This lets you configure

- App name
- / commands and the Ziggy Flows they invoke.
- Scope control

## Multiple Slack Apps
If you want to have several discreet Slack Apps, no problem. You can configure each App with its own / commands and scope permissions.
