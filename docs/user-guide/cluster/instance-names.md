title: Instance Naming
---

You can optionally provide instance names in the `.env` file on each of your servers. This is the recommended approach for user-friendly naming. 

`SERVER_NAME=Instance2`

If you have provided a name in the `.env` file, then this will be shown in the Ziggy UI. Otherwise, it will display the AWS/Azure instance name.
