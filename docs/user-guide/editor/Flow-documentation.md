# Documenting a Flow

There are two ways you can add documentation to a Flow. Both of these support Markdown.

## Info button and pane
Most of the tutorials use this to explain the contents.
In the button bar of the Flow Editor is the Info button.

<img src="/img/flows/info/info-button.png" alt="Info button" width="550" />

If there is Flow Information available, the button will be green,

Press this to open the **Flow Information Editor**. The content is rendered as shown below.

<img src="/img/flows/info/info-html.png" alt="Rendered" width="500" />

## Editing
You can edit the Flow Information by pressing the edit button. You can then write your content in markdown.

<img src="/img/flows/info/info-markdown.png" alt="Markdown" width="500" />

### Images
You can specify an image width as follows.

```javascript
![400](https://yoursite.com/path/image.png)
```

### Video
Simple embedding of YouTube and Vimeo videos is supported.

```javascript
[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID)
[vimeo](https://vimeo.com/123456789)
```

## Annotations Block
You can add the [Annotation Block](Annotation.md) to your Flow and position it anywhere. It is resizable.
