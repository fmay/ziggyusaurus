title: Documenting Flows
---

You can add some simple documentation to your Flows in two ways.

## Block annotation
Below, you can see a Block with an annotation in the header. Click the **?** icon in the Block header to set the text in the **Info** tab.

<img src="/img/considerations/block-annotation.png" alt="Block annotation" width="300" />

## Canvas annotation
You can add [Annotation Blocks](../../docs/user-guide/block-types/core/Annotation.md) to the canvas where you can write markdown copy.
