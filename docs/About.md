# Overview

Ziggy Services is a product for Systems Integrators and System Architects with a focus on

- Integrations
- Migrations
- Data Transformations and Quality checks

It focuses on

- Ease-of-use using **Custom Blocks**
- Rapid development with minimal blocks

And it comes in two flavors.

- **Shared Platform** - a shared platform that is intended for proof-of-concepts and testing. While
  we implement stringent security measures, it is not as secure as Ziggy Solo, which is fully
  private. Performance is good but not as fast and controllable as Ziggy Solo.
- **Ziggy Solo** - a private Ziggy instance, where you can manage all aspects of DevOps and
  security, or we can manage it on your behalf
- **Ziggy Solo Source Code** - Ziggy solo with source code.
