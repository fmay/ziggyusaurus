title: Edge validations, transformations and mapping
---

Ziggy offers two ways to handle data validations, transformations and mapping.

- **[Javascript Block](../../docs/user-guide/block-types/core/Javascript.md)** - for more complex custom logic.
- **[Edge Based](../../docs/user-guide/Structures-and-mapping.md)** - a standardised, dialog driven approach

The Edge based approach has the benefit of using Structures provide a standardised approach to defining data structures and associated validations that can be reused in multiple Flows. If you were to used Javascript, you might end up duplicating code.
 
It can often make sense to combine both approaches.
