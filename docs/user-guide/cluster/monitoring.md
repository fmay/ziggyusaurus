title: Monitoring
---

There are two ways to monitor the load.

- [Flow Execution Monitor](docs/user-guide/flow-execution-monitor.md) - shows you live flow throughput and key server indicators (CPU, Memory, System Queue status).
- [System Monitor](user-guide/Global-Settings.md#system-monitor) in Global Settings, which provides more detail.
- [Queues page](/user-guide/Queuing.md) - shows you key System Queue metrics.

Monitoring load and performance tuning is important for higher load scenarios. 

You should pay particular attention to the System Queue overflow (on the Queues page) as this will slow overall performance and is a sign that performance needs to be adjusted or a Ziggy cluser is required.
