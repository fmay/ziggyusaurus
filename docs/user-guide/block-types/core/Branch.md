# Branch Block

The Branch Block is a core block type that provides conditional flow control based on data conditions. It enables complex decision-making and routing within flows.

## Overview

The Branch Block is responsible for:
- Evaluating conditional expressions
- Routing data to different output paths
- Implementing business logic decisions
- Managing flow control based on data values

## Configuration

Branch blocks can be configured with various options including:
- Conditional expressions
- Output path mapping
- Default routing behavior
- Error handling options

## Usage

Branch blocks are typically placed after data sources to route data based on specific conditions or business rules.

## Related Blocks

- [Branch-To-Subflow](/block-types/core/Branch-To-Subflow) - For calling subflows conditionally
- [Merger](/block-types/core/Merger) - For combining branched paths
- [Collector](/block-types/core/Collector) - For gathering data from multiple paths

## Use Cases

- **Data Routing**: Route data based on content or conditions
- **Business Logic**: Implement decision-making in flows
- **Error Handling**: Route errors to appropriate handlers
- **Data Filtering**: Separate data into different processing paths

## Best Practices

- Use clear, readable conditional expressions
- Ensure all output paths are properly connected
- Test branch conditions with various data scenarios
- Consider default routing for unexpected conditions
