# Migration

The video below shows we use Ziggy to handle a migration of **companies**, **deals** and 
**line items** from a SQL database. The associations are also fully handled so you end up 
with fully associated records in HubSpot. 

The SQL database could be substituted with any other database, platform or API.

When you install the Hubspot App, you will get a set of migration tutorials that contain all the Flows shown in the video.
