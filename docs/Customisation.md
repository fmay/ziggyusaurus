# Customisation and Source Code

There are two ways to customise and extend Ziggy. 

1. We can do it for you, including adding Custom Blocks. This encapsulates complex functionality in simple blocks.
2. You can do it yourself by working with the Ziggy source code.

## Source Code
Working with the source code has the following benefits.

- You can add your own Custom Utility Blocks
- You can enhance and modify the system to suit your needs
- You can fix issues you may encounter without requesting us to do this for you, giving complete control over all eventualities.

Source code managed in a GitHub repository. You can fork a specific Ziggy version or merge and test updates.

## Overview
[Custom Utility Blocks](Custom-Utility-Blocks.md) provides an overview of what is involved in creating your own Custom Block.
