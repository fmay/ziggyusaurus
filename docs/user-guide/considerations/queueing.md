There are two types of queues.

- System Level Queue : all Flows are automatically placed in this queue to prevent system overload.
- User Defined Queue : the best way to apply rate limit protection for 3rd party (or internal) services, often REST API calls.

Please refer to [Queuing](user-guide/Queuing.md) for full details.
