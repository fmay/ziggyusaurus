title: AI Edge Assistant
---

This is a powerful, AI support means of performing 

- Validations
- Transformations
- Mappings

You run or step though your flow to the point where the edge has data on it.

You then click on the AI icon (click on the edge first if the assistant is not yet configured) to bring up the assistant.

You should provide a clear prompt like the one shown in the above image. If you don't need validations then don't mention them.

You press the send icon to generate everything. A test will automatically be run and the results displayed in the left column in the **Tests passed** and **Tests failed** tabs. 

## Validations
Below is another example flow that demonstrates this in more detail.

You can see we have some simple test data. Two of the records have bad data.

- `age` is commented out for Anna
- `name` has the wrong key name (`namex`)

If we bring up the AI Assistant and press **Test** we have 

### Data In
This is the data that came into the edge

### Test Passed
You can see only one record validated correctly

### Test failed
Here you can see the two failed records and the reason for failure.

### Transformed Data
In our prompt, we specified `Output as 'name  - age'`.

When you step past the edge, you can see this tabs populated with the correctly transformed data for any records that validated successfully.

## Data Store
Notice in the above prompt, we said `Put failed records in the datastore namespace 'abcd'`.

This will insert failed validations in the [data store browser](/user-guide/Data-and-Memory-Store-Browser.md) under the namespace `abcd`. You can then access this later within this flow or other flows however you like.

There's more information about the [Data Store](/user-guide/block-types/utility/Data-Store.md) here. 

## Convert to JS
If you ever want to switch to using a Javascript block instead of the AI Assistant, you can press the **Convert to JS** button.

This inserts a new Javascript block into the flow with the same logic that was generated by the AI Assistant.

You should be aware that you will have the following return statement as the AI Assistant can handle validations. Subsequent blocks should work with `passed` and `failed`.

```javascript
return { o0: { passed, failed } }
```
