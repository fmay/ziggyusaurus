# Flow Execution history

**IMPORTANT** - please also read the [History data storage level](/user-guide/History-data-storage-levels) topic for important information on how to configure what snapshot data is stored for an execution history item.

There are two ways to view the execution history for one Flow.

- In the Flow editor for the currently loaded Flow
- In the [Execution History dashboard](Monitoring.md)

Click on the circled history icon in the toolbar to load the history for the loaded Flow.

You then see a listing of recent executions for the Flow.

Click a row to load that past execution (read-only) into the Flow editor.
