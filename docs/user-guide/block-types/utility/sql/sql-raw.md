# RAW

You can enter a raw SQL command that will be executed on the defined Connection.

This does not currently support processing of incoming edge data. This will be added later.  
Please inquire if you have a need for this. 

## Return data from query
If you check this and your query returns data, the returned data will be placed on the outgoing edge. 

If not checked, the incoming edge data will be passed through.
