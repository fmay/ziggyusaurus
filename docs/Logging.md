# Logging

There are four places to see log information, two of which you can write to from your Flows.

## Execution History Log
This is written to during Flow execution when using the Editor. This information is also stored in the [Execution History](Execution-history.md), if enabled.

This is shown in the lower right pane of the Flow editor.

## Alert Log
Logging information generated by system and JS BLock used-generated alerts. 

Refer to [Alerts](Alerts.md) for a detailed explanation.

## Console Log
This is reserved for use by your Flows and appears in the bottom left pane of the Flow editor.

You write to this from a [Javascript Block](Javascript.md) using ```consoleMsg()```, which behaves like a regular ```console.log()``` statement.

## System Log
You can also write to the system log files, which are stored in the ```volume-data/logs``` folder.

### Log viewer
There is a [System Log Viewer](Global-Settings.md#system-logs) in the Global Settings.

### Write to log from Javascript Block
Write to system logs using ```sysLog.(log|warn|debug|verbose|error)```. See the [Javascript Block](Javascript.md) for details.
