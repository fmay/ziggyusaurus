title: Load testing
---

Load testing helps you adjust performance settings and estimate the performance of a Ziggy cluster under varying levels of load.

Ziggy provides simple [load testing](/user-guide/Global-Settings.md#load-test) in Global Settings. It lets you execute a chosen flow a specified nuber of times with varying frequencies. Using this features will slow the system a little as it runs on the Ziggy server itself.

You can run your own load tests using other software that will let you run multiple different flows with various patterns.

## Monitoring and tuning
You should use the load test in conjunction with [performance tuning](/user-guide/Performance-Tuning.md) and the [Flow Execution Monitor](/user-guide/flow-execution-monitor.md).
