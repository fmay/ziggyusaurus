# About Ziggy

## AI Search
Ziggy is a platform for perform highly configurable AI driven search.

**Any data, in any of your systems, platforms and databases can be made fully searchable using natural language queries. There is rarely any need for any form of coding. However, if you want to handle edge-cases with code, you can.**

## Flows
Ziggy Flows handle the customization of your Flows.

- Perform any data validation, transformation and mappings.
- Handle any custom logic
- Connect directly to databases, CRMs, ERPs, APIs - in fact pretty well anything - using Flow Blocks. 
- Collections of platform specific Blocks to connect to platforms like Hubspot, SalesForce, Databases and Warehouses etc, handling not just reading but object associations, record owner translations etc.

## API
Each Flow is accessible through an API call, so you can trigger ingestions, WebHook handlers, migrations, integrations that can support your search Flows.

## Installation
Ziggy is installed in any cloud platform just using Docker. This means you have total control over security and performance.

## Customization
Ziggy is not limited to one, predefined way of doing things. The whole point of Ziggy is to give you total control over all aspects, using Flows to achieve this. 

So no matter where your data lives or how you want to search it, you can do it.
