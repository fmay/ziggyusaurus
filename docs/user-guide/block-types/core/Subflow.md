# Subflow

Using Subflows helps you keep your Flows modular and reusable.

Once your prototyped your Flow, which will often use a few Javascript Blocks, you can hide it away in a Subflow to keep the Flows that use it as tidy as possible.

There's very little to configuring the Subflow Block.

You only need to specify the Subflow name.

You should flag a Subflow by opening the Flow properties in the UI and checking the "This flow can be used as a Subflow" box.
