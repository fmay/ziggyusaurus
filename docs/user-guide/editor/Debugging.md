# Debugging

![Debugging](/img/flows/debugging/debugging-nw-to-hs.png)

The Ziggy editor has a visual debugger so you can step through your Flow and look at edge data as the flow executes.

- **Restart** - if you are stepping, this restarts the Flow.
- **Stop** - stops the Flow.
- **Run** - executes the Flow without interruption. You can inspect the edge data at completion and examine the Flow log pane to see executed Blocks. If you are currently stepping, this will run the Flow to completion.
- **Pause** - pauses a running Flow.
- **Step** - step through the Flow one Block at a time. The Block that will execute next is highlighted in green. You can inspect the incoming edge data at this point.
