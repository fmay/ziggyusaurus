# Case Study - HubSpot

This case study shows how to use Ziggy to perform a **Data Migration**, an **Integration** as well as some helpful utilities. 

- **Migration** - migrating companies, deals and line items into Hubspot. [Show me](Migration.md).
- **Integration** - updating another system or systems when something changes in Hubspot. [Show me](Integration.md).
