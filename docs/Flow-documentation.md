# Documenting a Flow

There are two ways you can add documentation to a Flow. Both of these support Markdown.

## Info button and pane
Most of the tutorials use this to explain the contents.
In the button bar of the Flow Editor is the Info button.

If there is Flow Information available, the button will be green,

Press this to open the **Flow Information Editor**. The content is rendered as shown below.

## Editing
You can edit the Flow Information by pressing the edit button. You can then write your content in markdown.

```

### Video
Simple embedding of YouTube and Vimeo videos is supported.

## Annotations Block
You can add the [Annotation Block](Annotation.md) to your Flow and position it anywhere. It is resizable.
