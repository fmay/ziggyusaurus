# Named Saves

Flows are auto-saved. However, you can create a snapshot at any time, called a **Named Save**.

Press the button and choose a name. The current state of your Flow will be saved.

## Finding and restoring Named Saves
Named Saves can be found by pressing the History button next to the save button.

Make sure the **Only named saves** option is checked. You can then see all named saves for the Flow.
