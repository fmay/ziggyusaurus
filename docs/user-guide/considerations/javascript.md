title: Javascript 
---

The Javascript is an essential Block for handling edge cases, where there is no standard block available. It is perfect for dealing with special or complex data transformations that require custom logic. 

The nice thing about this Block is that it has a full code editor with linting, suggestions and debugging that let you debug your blocks while the Flow is running.

You can also perform Batching operations should you need to.

## Alternatives
For simpler requirements, you can use the functionality provided on the Edge for data transformations, validations and data mapping. 

Refer to [Structures and Mapping](user-guide/Structures-and-mapping.md) for detailed information.
