You can assign individual users and/or teams to access Flows, Connections, Secrets, Schedules and Messaging Items.

When you open the Flow settings or individual items dialogs, you will see **Users** and **Teams** buttons.

From those, you can assign users and/or teams with specific roles for that item.
