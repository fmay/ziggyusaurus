# Dev/Prod Modes

You can run Flows in Development and Production mode. Each mode automatically selects the development or production [Secrets](Secrets.md) and [Connections](Connections.md).

## Select the mode in the editor
You can change mode by clicking the large box in the top right of the Flow editor.

## Select mode when launching via the API
You can also specify which mode a Flow should operate in when launching a Flow from the API. This is explained in more detail in the [Launching Flows](Launching-flows.md) topic.
