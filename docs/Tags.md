# Tags

Once you have a lot of Flows, Structures or Secrets, it can be helpful to organise these using tags.

## Setting tags
Each of these allows tags to be assigned in the respective settings dialog.

## Filtering
Each of the main listings for these entities has a tags filter option.

When you start typing, the available tags for the entity are shown in the dropdown.
