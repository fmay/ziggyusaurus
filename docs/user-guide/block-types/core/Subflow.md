title: Subflow Block

# Subflow

Using Subflows helps you keep your Flows modular and reusable.

Once your prototyped your Flow, which will often use a few Javascript Blocks, you can hide it away in a Subflow to keep the Flows that use it as tidy as possible.

There's very little to configuring the Subflow Block.

You only need to specify the Subflow name.
