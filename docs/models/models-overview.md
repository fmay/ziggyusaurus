## Training Models
We can train models for you that you can plug into Ziggy. You can also train your own models and load them into Ziggy.


## Bulk Updating
You can create Flows that load any platform or database with current predictive indicators. These values can then appear in your CRM, ERP or other platforms and systems.

Below is an example Flow that does this.

## Incremental Updating
Rather than perform a large bulk load every time you want to bring your data up to date, you can trigger a Flow that calculates the indicators on single records whenever the underlying data for those records has changed.
