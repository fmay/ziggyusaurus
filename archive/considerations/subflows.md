title: Subflows
---

[Subflows](../../docs/user-guide/block-types/core/Subflow.md) should be used in two general situations.

- To avoid duplication
- To prevent Flows become too large where the oversight is easily lost.

Other than that a Subflow behaves like a regular Flow.

Subflows can then be launched from other Flows using the [Subflow Block](../../docs/user-guide/block-types/core/Subflow.md).
