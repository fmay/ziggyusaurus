- The **Name** field should not contain spaces and is limited to characters that are permitted in a Javascript variable.
- Add **Tags** if you have a lot of secrets and want to find them from the main secrets listing.

## Development and Production values
A secret should always have a development value. This also acts as the production value if nothing is provided in the **Production value** field.

Ziggy will select the appropriate value at runtime. See [Dev/Prod mode](/user-guide/Dev-Prod-Modes) for information on switching modes.

## Where do I reference secrets from?
There are two places where you reference a secret.

### Connections
When defining a [Connection](Connections), you can specify a secret.

### Javascript Block
You can reference a connection in a Javascript Block like this.

```JavaScript
const apiKey = secrets.NORTHWIND_DB_PASSWORD
```
